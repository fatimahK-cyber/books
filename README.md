HI there, welcome to Readist, Your Personalized tracker for books!

Readist was developed as part of a university course, Web & Script Development (INFR3120U), to practice building a secure, full CRUD web application using Node.js and related technologies. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete book entries through a clean and responsive interface.
The web application also allows for User login and authentication via local registration, Google, and GitHub.

All work in this project is my own and was completed based on course lectures, labs, and official documentation. I used Bootstrap along with my own custom CSS to design the user interface.


Features
Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality
Shared header and footer using EJS partials
Public page displaying all stored book entries
Environment variables used for database security
Cloud deployment with a connected MongoDB database
